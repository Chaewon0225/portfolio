							<h1>Future Research</h1>
							<p>I have a very solid future research plan that will keep me busy for the coming five years. Plans change, of course, but my productivity won't change.</p> 
							<p>All the items are currently ongoing or under preparation, and some are open for collaborations (marked with &#10084;). With my experience of mentoring undergraduate students, I can use these as great opportunities to engage undergraduate or graduate students in research and get them started.</p>

							<h2>Educational Escape Rooms in Nursing Education</h2>
							<p>Collaborators: Ronnie Brewer, Tammy Paarlberg</p>
								<li>[&#10084;] <b>Design-based Research</b></li>
								<p>This article will compile the experiments I have done with the design elements in the escape room, specifically, competition and role allocation. It will be basically an extension of my dissertation, with more focus on knowledge gains and suggesting design principles.</p>
								<li><b>A Systematic Review of Design Elements</b></li>
								<p>This is a systematic review of 68 studies on using educational escape rooms in healthcare education. This paper is currently under review for publication in <i>Educational Research Review</i>.</p>
								<li>[&#10084;] <b>Multimodal Video Analysis</b></li>
								<p>I am exploring various tools such as BROMP, ELAN, and Microsoft Azure AI Foundry to analyze the EER videos. The purpose is to identify coupling moments of collaborative problem solving and affective states, thus contributing to the emotional aspect of collaborative learning theories.</p>
								<li>[&#10084;] <b>Virtual EER</b></li>
								<p>With the data collected from virtual EER (planned to be deployed in Spring 2026), I will look into the different impact of fidelities on nursing students' cognitive load and academic performance.</p>
								<li><b>Group Conversation Analysis</b></li>
								<p>Working with researchers from UC Irvine, I plan to implement group conversation analysis on my dataset to see if it reveals any nuances of students' collaborative problem solving dynamics.</p>
								<li>[&#10084;] <b>Reflection on Drug Math EER</b></li>
								<p>Tammy and I are working on creating an EER focused on medication dosage calculation, which many nursing students find challenging. We will design different types of debriefing, and see how such changes in design impacts students' reflective practices through the lens of experiential learning theory.</p>
							<h2>Supporting Neurodiversity in Rural Areas</h2>
							<p>Collaborators: Fengfeng Ke, James Whyte, Xin Yuan, Tusher Chandra Mondol, Saptarshi Bhowmik</p>
								<li><b>Targeting International Journal of Qualitative Research</b></li>
								<p>This article will report the holistic results from the 26 interviews with caregivers, teachers, and healthcare providers who support neurodiversity in rural areas.</p>
								<li><b>Targeting International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction</b></li>
								<p>This article will provide a human-AI collaboration workflow on qualitative deductive coding, demonstrate how we handled the traditional challenges of qualitative research, such as the unit of analysis, quality evaluation, and scalability.</p>
								<li>[&#10084;] <b>Guiding Parenting of Neurodiversity with Online Community Support</b></li>
								<p>I crawled data from Reddit on how parents use the community to inform their parenting of neurodivergent children. This article will examine how they leverage online spaces to navigate challenges using socio-ecological systems theory and natural language processing.</p>
							<h2>Leveraging Emerging Technologies for Human Wellness (AI, Educational Data Mining)</h2>
								<li><b>Developing RAG Chatbot for School Counselors</b></li>
								<p>Collaborators: Dowon Choi, Saptarshi Bhowmik</p>
								<p>This article will show the preliminary results of testing the PsycBot, a RAG chatbot for novice school counselors to help navigate the state-specific legal documents to inform their practice.</p>
								<li><b>Investigating LLM's Gender Bias</b></li>
								<p>Collaborators: Jaeyoon Choi, Nia Nixon</p>
								<p>We're using the conversational dataset from my nursing EER project to investigate the inherent gender bias of currently available LLMs.</p>
								<li><b>Developing a Course Assistant Chatbot for School Administrators' Understanding of Neurodiversity</b></li>
								<p>Collaborators: Songhee Han, Jueun Shin, Jiyoon Han, Sihan Jian</p>
								<p>Working with FSU Institute for Trauma and Resilience Studies, I am participating in a project where we develop and deploy a course assistant RAG chatbot for school administrators' understanding of neurodiversity.</p>
								<li>[&#10084;] <b>Exploring Youtube as Informal Learning Spaces of Financial Literacy</b></li>
								<p>Collaborator: Gi Woong (Josh) Choi</p>
								<p>Financial literacy is something schools don't spend much time teaching, but essential in leading a happy, secure life. We investigate how people use Youtube as informal learning spaces to navigate their financial aspect of lives.</p>
							<h2>Developing a Serious Game for Healthy Eating Habits</h2>
								<p>Collaborators: Sun Young park</p>
								<li>[&#10084;] <b>Design-based Research</b></li>
								<p>This article will trace our three iterations on the design and development of serious game for promoting healthy eating habits of young adults, along with design principles for serious games within non-academic domain.</p>
							<h2>Contributing to the Field of Learning Science</h2>
								<p>Collaborators: Hakeoung Hannah Lee, Seungjie Clarice Han, Jaesung Hur, Hyeji Jang</p>
								<li><b>A Systematic Review of Network Analyses in Collaborative Learning</b></li>
								<p>This collaboration started from a conversation at ISLS 2025 that many use network analysis to investigate the dynamics of collaborative learning, but we lack an overview for novice in the field on which network analysis is suitable for which context, etc. We are currently working on full text extraction.</p>
