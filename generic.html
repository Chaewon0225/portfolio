							<p>I have been working with two teaching faculty members in the College of Nursing at Florida State University, Ronnie Brewer and Tammy Paarlberg, since 2023.
We developed two escape room scenarios, and we're currently working on two more new escape room scenarios; each will be deployed in an online course about nursing policy and an in-person course on medication dosage calculation.
While working with collaborators from nursing, I have been independently researching the theoretical foundations and design principles of educational escape rooms. Please find relevant publications to the questions I answered about educational escape rooms in nursing.</p>
							<p>I have 8 video clips of students working in an escape room, each about 30 minutes long.
I am working with Jaeyoon Choi and Nia Nixon from the University of California, Irvine, to analyze the data using Group Conversation Analysis and to investigate the large language model's gender bias.
I am working with Yusong Liang, an undergraduate research assistant from the Computer Science department at Florida State University, to use Microsoft Azure AI Foundry to detect real-time emotions.
I am working with emerging scholars in the field of educational technology and learning sciences on developing this project as design-based research.
I will collect more data from the new escape room scenarios being deployed in Spring 2026. Both will be designed as a quasi-experimental study with expected publications in early 2027.</p>
